This is one of my first projects that involved coding a website from scratch based on a design I created. It proved to be quite difficult in terms of coding different parts of the site - a lot of time was spent on youtube and google to solve some issues such as alignment. The project was especially exciting as it was the first time I had created a website that used my own personal domain, which provided its own challenges. 

Overall, I was able to use my knowledge of HTML and CSS along with my design skills to create my personal website. By completing this project, I have been able to enhance my knowledge of HTML/CSS and overall web development.

I have written a detailed report on this project that goes through me thoguht process and how I designed and coded my personal portfolio.
